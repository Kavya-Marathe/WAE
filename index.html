        <h1 style="color:red;">Work in Physics</h1>
        <p>
            In physics, <b>work is the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement. In its simplest form, it is often represented as the product of force and displacement.</b>
             A force is said to do positive work if (when applied) it has a component in the direction of the displacement of the point of application. 
            A force does negative work if it has a component opposite to the direction of the displacement at the point of application of the force.
            For example, when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped, the work done by the gravitational force on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball (a force) multiplied by the distance to the ground (a displacement).
            For work to be done, a force must be exerted and there must be motion or displacement in the direction of the force. The work done by a force acting on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved in the direction of the force. 
            Work is a scalar quantity,so it has only magnitude and no direction. Work transfers energy from one place to another, or one form to another. 
            The concept of work in physics is much more narrowly defined than the common use of the word. 
            Work is done on an object when an applied force moves it through a distance. 
            <img src="work 1.jpg" alt="Work done"style="width:50%;">
            In our everyday language, work is related to expenditure of muscular effort, but this is not the case in the language of physics. A person that holds a heavy object does no physical work because the force is not moving the object through a distance. Work, according to the physics definition, is being accomplished while the heavy object is being lifted but not while the object is stationary. 
            Another example of the absence of work is a mass on the end of a string rotating in a horizontal circle on a frictionless surface. The centripetal force is directed toward the center of the circle and, therefore, is not moving the object through a distance; that is, the force is not in the direction of motion of the object. 
            (However, work was done to set the mass in motion.)
          </p>
          <h3 style="color:crimson;">Formula of Work</h3>
          <p>
          The work done by a force is defined to be the product of component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement.
           W = (F cos θ )d = F.d
           We understand from the work equation that if there is no displacement, there is no work done, irrespective of how large the force is. To summarize, we can say that no work is done if:<br>
 
           <li>The displacement is zero</li>
           <li>The force is zero</li>
           <li>The force and displacement are mutually perpendicular to each other.</li>
           </p>

           <h3 style="color:crimson;">SI unit of Work</h3>
            <p>
                The SI unit of work is the joule (J), named after the 19th-century English physicist James Prescott Joule, which is defined as the work required to exert a force of one newton through a displacement of one metre.
                The dimensionally equivalent newton-metre (N⋅m) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work, but this can be confused with the measurement unit of torque. Usage of N⋅m is discouraged by the SI authority, since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of work
                Non-SI units of work include the newton-metre, erg, the foot-pound, the foot-poundal, the kilowatt hour, the litre-atmosphere, and the horsepower-hour. Due to work having the same physical dimension as heat, occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content, such as therm, BTU and calorie, are utilized as a measuring unit.
         </p>
            
           <h3 style="color: blue;">Types of Work</h3>
           <p>
           The work is divided into the following three types, depending on the force acting on an object and the angle created by the direction of displacement of the object: <br>
           <li>Positive Work</li>
           <li>Negative Work</li>
           <li>Zero Work</li>
          </p>

          <h4 style="color: crimson;">Positive Work</h4>
          <p>
            When force and displacement are in the same direction, the work performed on an object is said to be positive work. 
            When the displacement of the body the in the direction of the force then the work done is positive. 
            Where force and displacement both are in the positive state , work is said to be positive.
            eg :<br>
            <li>A nurse pushing a patient on a wheelchair</li>
            In this picture we see that a nurse is taking a patient on a wheelchair from one point to another. We see that the force she is applying is along the way of displacement.
            Thus , the work done is positive.
            <img src="positive work 1.gif" alt=" Positive Work done"style="width:50%;"><br>
            <li>A boy pushing a big box</li>
            In this picture we see that a boy is pushing a box . The force he is applying makes the box move in the direction of displacement . Thus , work done is positive.
            <img src="positive work 2.gif" alt=" Positive Work done"style="width:50%;"><br>
             </p>


             <h4 style="color: crimson;">Negative Work</h4>
             <p>
              Negative work is performed if the displacement is opposite to the direction of the Force applied.
              The work done is said to be negative work when force and displacement are in opposite direction.
              By work-energy theorem, we have that total work done on a body is equal to change in kinetic energy produced. It is intuitive that the positive work we do on something(i.e we apply some force on any body and that body moves in the direction of force) increases kinetic energy of the body. Many of us know, an object released from certain height attains some kinetic energy due to positive work done by the force of gravity.
              On the flip side, negative work done can be understood as the reduction in kinetic energy of the body.
              The angle formed in a negative work is 180 degree.
              eg :<br>
              <li>Launching of rocket from space station</li>
              In this picture we see that the rocket is launching from the space station . The displacement is above but the gravitational force of the earth is opposite of the displacement.
              As the angle formed is 180 degree , work done is negative.
              <img src="negative work 2.gif" alt=" Negative Work done"style="width:50%;"><br>
              <li>Buoyant force of water on drowning of ship</li>
              In this picture , buoyant or upward force of fluids is applied by water on the ship . The buoyant force is applied to make ship float , but because it is drowning it is moving in opposite direction.
              Here the work done is negative
              <img src="negative work 1.gif" alt=" Negative Work done"style="width:50%;"><br>
             </p>

             <h4 style="color: crimson;">Zero Work</h4>
             <p>
              Zero work is done when the displacement of a body is zero or perpendicular (θ=900,cosθ=0) to the direction of force applied, then work done is zero. 
              The work done is said to be zero work when force and displacement are perpendicular to each other or when either force or displacement is zero.
              The work is zero even when displacement or force applied is zero.
              eg:<br>
              <li>A coolie holding up a luggage</li>
              In this picture , a coolie is using his force to make luggage move and is displacing from one point to another point.
              But the angle formed between the force and displacementis 90 degree , we write it as cos90 = 0. In this case if the angle is zero, work done is equal to zero.
              <img src="zero work 1.gif" alt=" Negative Work done"style="width:50%;"><br>

              <li>A boy pushing a wall</li>
              In this picture , a boy is trying to push the wall with all his strenght. Even though the wall is not displacing.
              In this case as displacement is zero , work done is also zero.
